# LangGraph-AzureAI-Agents

**Clinical Patient-Engagement Multi-Agent System with LangGraph + Azure AI**

This repository contains an end-to-end AI-agent backend project that receives patient-style messages, classifies the message, routes it through a LangGraph workflow, calls mock clinical tools, applies safety checks, and returns a structured response through a FastAPI API deployed on Azure App Service.

> **Disclaimer:** This project is for education, experimentation, and portfolio demonstration only. It uses mock/synthetic clinical data. It is not a medical device, not clinical decision support, and not intended for real patient care.



## The product live demo:

After deployment, the API exposes a Swagger/OpenAPI browser UI:

```
A nice user interface is yet to be bulit for it!


## What I Built

This project is a small but complete **cloud-deployed clinical patient-engagement multi-agent API**.

It demonstrates:

- multi-step LangGraph orchestration,
- patient message triage,
- specialty routing,
- mock EHR lookup,
- mock appointment/task tools,
- safety and emergency escalation logic,
- FastAPI deployment,
- Azure App Service hosting,
- Azure OpenAI / Azure AI configuration through environment variables,
- and a public Swagger UI for testing.

## Model / System Stack

| Component | Tool |
|---|---|
| Agent orchestration | LangGraph |
| API framework | FastAPI |
| Cloud hosting | Azure App Service |
| LLM provider | Azure OpenAI / Azure AI Foundry deployment |
| Safety layer | Rule-based guardrails plus optional Azure AI Content Safety configuration |
| Data layer | Mock EHR SQLite database plus small processed CSV files |
| Deployment packaging | POSIX-safe ZIP built with Python `zipfile` |

The repository is organized in the same portfolio style as my other project repositories: the main source files are under `codes/`, visual and technical explanations are under `assets/`, and the root README provides the high-level story.




## Dataset Design

Original datasets are available here. The project expects dataset categories such as:

* Patient messages or healthcare conversations
* Appointment or scheduling data
* Hospital satisfaction or patient experience data
* EHR-style patient records
* Specialty or symptom labels

## Example API Calls

### Appointment request

```powershell
$body = @{
  patient_id = "P0000001"
  user_message = "I need to schedule a cardiology appointment next week."
} | ConvertTo-Json

Invoke-RestMethod `
  -Uri "https://<your-app-hostname>/run" `
  -Method Post `
  -ContentType "application/json" `
  -Body $body
```

### Emergency-style request

```powershell
$body = @{
  patient_id = "P0000001"
  user_message = "I have chest pain and shortness of breath."
} | ConvertTo-Json

Invoke-RestMethod `
  -Uri "https://<your-app-hostname>/run" `
  -Method Post `
  -ContentType "application/json" `
  -Body $body
```

Expected emergency routing:

```text
route = emergency_escalation_agent
needs_human = true
urgency = emergency
```

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `az` is not recognized | Azure CLI not in PowerShell PATH | Use full `az.cmd` path |
| Plain app URL does not work | Azure generated a unique hostname | Query `enabledHostNames` |
| ZIP deploy fails with `EINVAL` | Windows backslash paths inside ZIP | Build ZIP using `codes/scripts/build_posix_zip.py` |
| `/clinical_agent/api.py` is 404 | Deployment folder structure is wrong | Do not start FastAPI until file checks return 200 |
| `/health` returns 504 on first boot | Dependencies are installing | Watch logs and wait for Uvicorn startup |
| `No module named clinical_agent` | Import path issue | Copy package to root and add root/src to `sys.path` |
| Oryx temp folder misses files | Build output path issue | Disable Oryx and run from `/home/site/wwwroot` |

## Security Notes

Do not upload:

```text
.env
Azure keys
Kaggle API tokens
real patient data
subscription IDs
tenant IDs
personal email addresses
```

For real healthcare deployments, this would require authentication, authorization, audit logging, encryption, human-in-the-loop review, clinical validation, and compliance controls.

## Resume Bullet

**Clinical Patient-Engagement Multi-Agent System** — Built and deployed a LangGraph-based clinical message triage API on Azure App Service with FastAPI, mock EHR context, safety checks, routing logic, tool-calling behavior, and live Swagger documentation.

---

## Author’s Note

This project was built as a practical end-to-end deployment, not only as a notebook. The main value is the full path from local Python code to LangGraph orchestration to Azure App Service deployment and a live API demo.
